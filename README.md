# Hoarder
This script is made to collect the most valiable artifacts for foreniscs or incident reponse investigation rather than imaging the whole hard drive. 


#Compiling 
You will need to compile the code using pyinstaller "pyinstaller --onefile --onconsole hoarder.py" and copy rawcopy64.exe & hoarder.ymal to the same folder with the exeutable.

#Note: big thanks to jschicht for creating the amazing tool rawcopy which made ourlives easier. https://github.com/jschicht/RawCopy



#workthrough 
 all you need to exeute it with admin privileges and the rawcopy64.exe should be at the same folder and then it will create a zip file which contains a folder with multiple subfolder that holds all artifacts.
